## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Smart `finish_reason` correction for streaming tool_calls** 🎯
  - Automatically detects tool_calls in streaming responses
  - Corrects `finish_reason` from `"stop"` to `"tool_calls"` when tool_calls are present
  - Ensures Codex and other clients correctly execute tools instead of just displaying text
  - Preserves full streaming experience: users see both content and tool execution

### Changed
- **Updated llm-connector to 0.4.15**: Full streaming tool_calls support
  - ✅ llm-connector correctly parses streaming tool_calls from Zhipu API
  - ✅ Streaming mode now works correctly with tool messages
  - ✅ Zhipu GLM-4.6 streaming + tool messages fully functional
  - ✅ Codex workflow now works perfectly in streaming mode

### Fixed
- **Critical: `finish_reason` correction for tool_calls** 🔧
  - GLM-4.6 returns `finish_reason: "stop"` even when tool_calls are present
  - llm-link now detects tool_calls and corrects `finish_reason` to `"tool_calls"`
  - This fixes Codex not executing tools (Codex checks `finish_reason` to decide action)
  - Root cause: Codex's logic: `finish_reason == "tool_calls"` → execute tool, `== "stop"` → display text
- **Streaming tool_calls extraction**: Now correctly extracts from `choices[0].delta.tool_calls`
  - Was checking wrong field (`chunk.tool_calls` instead of `chunk.choices[0].delta.tool_calls`)
  - Now properly forwards tool_calls in streaming responses
- Streaming responses with tool messages now return complete content
- Tool calls now appear in real-time during streaming

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Full Tool Message Support**: Complete support for OpenAI-style tool messages workflow
  - Support for `role="tool"` messages in conversation history
  - Support for `tool_call_id` field in tool response messages
  - Support for `tool_calls` field in assistant messages
  - Enables multi-turn function calling conversations (Codex workflow)

### Changed
- **Updated llm-connector to 0.4.13**: Full tool message support
  - Message structure now includes `tool_calls` and `tool_call_id` fields
  - Role enum now includes `Tool` variant
  - Support for reasoning fields (reasoning_content, reasoning, thought, thinking)
- **Simplified message handling**: Now directly use llm-connector's Message type
  - Removed custom Message type conversion
  - Direct pass-through of tool_calls and tool messages
  - Better content extraction from various reasoning fields

### Fixed
- Tool messages now correctly passed to LLM (previously converted to user messages)
- Assistant messages with tool_calls now properly handled (content can be null)
- Content extraction now checks multiple fields (content, reasoning_content, reasoning)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Tool Calls Support in Non-Streaming Responses**: Full support for tool_calls in non-streaming mode
  - Added `tool_calls` field to Response structure
  - Extract and forward tool_calls from LLM responses
  - Compatible with OpenAI tool_calls format

### Changed

  - Added tools and tool_choice support to ZhipuRequest
  - Added tool_calls support to ZhipuMessage

### Fixed
- Non-streaming requests now properly pass tools parameter to LLM
